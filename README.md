## About

I created this fan game as a first project 
in order to learn how to develop games in the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) :robot:.

If you don't know the Duck Hunt game, you can 
[read about the original NES game Duck Hunt on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Hunt) :book:.

You can also watch a 
[YouTube playthrough video of Duck Hunt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd2AeH-P6r8) :movie_camera:
to get the idea.

Be sure to watch my [demo video of Duck Hunt Remastered on YouTube](https://youtu.be/rmo4hgRTLPo) :movie_camera: 
to see the game in action. :sunglasses:

Here are some screenshots of the game:

## How to play the game

I uploaded an HTML5-Export of the game to 
[itch.io](https://danielthefox.itch.io/duck-hunt-remastered), 
so that you can 
[play Duck Hunt Remastered in your web browser](https://danielthefox.itch.io/duck-hunt-remastered). :joystick::globe_with_meridians:

In addition, I uploaded 
[binary exports of the game for Mac OS, Windows and Linux](https://danielthefox.itch.io/duck-hunt-remastered) :joystick::computer:
to itch.io as well.

## Technical Restrictions

I encountered the following technical restrictions while testing the game in the following setups:

| Export Type      | OS  | Web Browser | Playable?    | Restrictions encountered |
| ---------------- | --- | ----------- | :----------: | ------------------------ |
| :globe_with_meridians: HTML5 on itch.io | :apple: MacOS 14.1 | Safari 17.1 | :white_check_mark: | You have to click once so that audio output is enabled. |
| :globe_with_meridians: HTML5 on itch.io | :apple: MacOS 14.1 | Chrome 119.0.6045.123 | :x: | Chrome freezes! :scream: |
| :globe_with_meridians: HTML5 on itch.io | :apple: MacOS 14.1 | Firefox 119.0.1 | :x: | Game freezes while loading! :scream: |
| :globe_with_meridians: HTML5 on itch.io | :penguin: Ubuntu 22.04.3 in VMWare Fusion 13.5.0 | Firefox 119.0.1 | :white_check_mark: | Cursor change on mouse hover on duck not working |

| :globe_with_meridians: HTML5 on itch.io | :window: Windows 11 Enterprise Evaluation, Build 22621 in VMWare Fusion 13.5.0 | Firefox 119.0.1 | :x: | ```Error: The following features required to run Godot projects on the Web are missing: WebGL2 - Check web browser configuration and hardware support``` :cry: |
| :globe_with_meridians: HTML5 on itch.io | :window: Windows 11 Enterprise Evaluation, Build 22621 in VMWare Fusion 13.5.0 | Chrome 119.0.6045.124 | :white_check_mark: | Cursor middle part not visible in embedded iframe, working though when maximized |
| :penguin: Linux binary | Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS in VMWare Fusion 13.5.0 | - | :white_check_mark: | Cursor change on mouse hover on duck not working |
| :apple: MacOS binary | MacOS 14.1 | - | :white_check_mark: | - |
| :window: Windows binary | Windows 11 Enterprise Evaluation, Build 22621 in VMWare Fusion 13.5.0 | - | :white_check_mark: | - |

While this is no 100% guarantee that the game functions on your setup,
it can give you a good indication.

Note: The SharedArrayBuffer support feature is activated on the game page on itch.io.

## How is this Duck Hunt fan game different?!

Fair question indeed and what started out as a spontaneous personal learning project 
that would never get shown to anybody, soon became a real passion for me. :heart:

I did research [other Duck Hunt fan games on itch.io](https://itch.io/search?q=Duck+Hunt), 
before deciding to upload my version of a Duck Hunt fan game. :duck:
Here's the points I identified that my game does differently in many cases:

* :joystick: Close to the original, but with a slight fresh touch, while sticking to the (S)NES style
* :sweat_smile: It's actually playable!
* :muscle: Playable in web browser (via itch.io) and downloadable as native binary for MacOS, Linux & Windows
* :teacher: GitHub repository including the source code of the game to learn from
* :movie_camera: Demo video & screenshots of game play
* :book: Detailed Readme
* :see_no_evil: Detailed comments and explanations in the source code, especially for pitfalls which some of cost me hours of debugging
* :robot: Created and working in Godot Engine version 4.1.3
* :notes: Background music & pond ambience sounds
* :cloud: Parallax clouds in the background
* :duck: Ducks can have 3 colors: blue, brown, red
* :dog2: Dog picks up the correctly colored shot duck
* :ear_of_rice: Intro animation in which the dog jumps behind the grass
* :dart: Animation for completing a round (shooting 10 ducks)
* :duck: Ducks shot scream and then fall behind grass
* :gun: Points appear where duck was shot
* :rocket: Duck flies out of grass from random X position
* :rofl: Dog laughs at you on game over
* :duck: Duck bounces of window boundaries and top edge of grass
* :smirk: The info boxes on the bottom part of the foreground are separate sprites which get scaled according to their content and on window resize (see Godot Engine docs on [NinePatchRect](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_ninepatchrect.html))
* :stopwatch: A timer shows time elapsed (mm:ss) since game start
* :dart: Local highscore stored in a text file in the user space for downloaded game versions
* :bust_in_silhouette: Random player name generator for highscore to keep it clean from profanity :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
* :dart: Online highscore for game version played in web browser on itch.io

As this is my first game in Godot Engine, I'm really proud of how it turned out and what I was able to learn so far! :star_struck:

## Resources used
* [The Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org), Version 4.1.3 :robot:
* This project is inspired by the great
[Duck Hunt in Godot 4 tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLzwaMF8Zbk) and 
[example Duck Hunt project](https://github.com/16BitDev/duck-hunt/) by 
[16BitDev](https://www.youtube.com/@16bitdev) :heart:
* The
 [sprites for the animated ducks, animated dog, background & foreground](https://www.spriters-resource.com/custom_edited/duckhuntcustoms/sheet/63915/)
 are from Pik on spriters-resource.com. I did tweak them here and there a bit.
* The [pixel clouds](https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-clouds-pixel-art-asset-pack/) are from craftpix.net
* The [Pixel Operator font](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/pixel-operator#Pixel%20Operator%20SC-Bold) is from fontlibrary.org
* The [crosshairs cursor](https://kenney.nl/assets/crosshair-pack) and [regenerate icon](https://kenney.nl/assets/input-prompts-pixel-16) are from kenney.nl
* All [sound effects and music](https://freesound.org) are from freesound.org
* I based the custom mouse cursor on the great 
[tutorial by Jon Topielski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrQ1-Ea6_KM). 
I had to make quite some changes though in order to get it to run in Godot Engine 4.
* The random player name generator is inspired by the [random container names in Docker](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/pkg/namesgenerator/names-generator.go)
* The online highscore is powered by the great [SilentWolf backend services for Godot Engine](https://www.silentwolf.com)
